# this code is for measuring features of butterfly scales from Electron Microscopy images. You may measure width and periodicity of features. Note that your micrographs must be appropriate magnification for any given feature, and have even contrast. 

1. Obtain measures of greyscale pixel intensity along a line segment using ImageJ for many scales
2. Place all files in same directory, run the R code. One output file will be generated per input file.
